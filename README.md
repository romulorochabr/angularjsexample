# angularjsexample
This is a AngularJS example using Controllers, Routers and Services. Note that all controllers and services are in different files as a prove of concept. 

It is not integrated with Back End, only the list page retrieves JSON data from customer service in order to show how to use Services.

Run this example using Apache or other http server. I have used Apache 2.4.23 running with Docker.

FrontEnd : AngularJS V1

This project includes the following features:

1) Main Page or Login Page - Main page is load when root domain is accessed. Contains links to different pages, Email and Password Fields, Login Button and Binding Values.   </br>
2) Reset Password Page - showing how routes, inputs and button works with Controllers.</br>
3) Non Route Domain - exercise how handle requests to non existents urls.</br>
4) List - Retrieves data from JSON Service and create a table using ng-repeat. </br>
 
 
All those features are links placed in the main page.

Have fun!
